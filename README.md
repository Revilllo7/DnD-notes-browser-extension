# DnD-notes-browser-extension
A browser extension that let's you write down and organise your session notes based on date, session number or keywords.


**Work in progress**
Organise your dnd notes using your browser.
Look up character names, places or add your own keywords that let you look things up quick.
Keep track of ongoing quests, npcs, spells, inventory.




Slow to update, working on it as a fun project in spare time while having no idea how to make browser extensions.
See you in the notes Critters.
